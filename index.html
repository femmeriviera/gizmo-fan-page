      <p>Gizmo (also often referred to as "Giz" by Billy) is an adorable, very
        kind Mogwai who is part of Billy Peltzerâ€™s life. Originally owned by
        Mr. Wing, Gizmo lives with Billy and Kate Peltzer in New York. Gizmo helps
        Billy defeat the gremlins each time they get loose. Gizmo can also
        display many emotions. </p>

      <p>Gizmo is the infamous cute, kind, lovable, adorable Mogwai. Despite not being vicious like the other gremlins, and most other Mogwai, Gizmo has shown he's just as adept as they are with weapons and electrical devices. Gizmo knows how to work that electrical keyboard, turning on a television, operating a toy car, playing a trumpet, and well just being plain adorable. Not to mention, making an effective bow and arrow out of office supplies. This might be a reference to his name, as the word "gizmo" means a gadget.

Gizmo has shown a love for TV, which he developed while in the Peltzers' cared for him in the first movie. While Mr. Wing found the idea of the mogwai watching TV ridiculous, it has proven to be useful for Gizmo as in the first film, he watched a movie involving a race and he became interested in cars, or as he called them 'Vroom-Vroom.' In the climax, Gizmo drove a toy car through the department store to get to the greenhouse department before Stripe's new army was born. In the second movie, TV proves its use for Gizmo again as he recalled what the hero of the Rambo movie did and mimicked those tactics with amazing results.

Then Gizmo was responsible for the destruction of the leaders of both batches (interestingly, Stripe met his demise following the destruction of his army, whereas Mohawk was destroyed before). It should be noted that Gizmo took a much more direct approach in Mohawk's destruction than Stripe's, as he shot Mohawk with a flaming arrow in the second movie, whereas he indirectly destroyed Stripe by exposing him to sunlight in the original. Then Gizmo became much more assertive than he was in the first movie because, as Billy said, "they pushed him too far."

According to the novelization of the first film, the mogwai are a result of genetic manipulations by an alien scientist to create a creature that would evoke good-naturedness and goodwill amongst the galaxy. However, a slight miscalculation caused all but 1 in 10,000 to be mischievous or evil and the transformation mogwai can go through being totally unintended. Only one in ten thousand are gentle and as a result, is hated by their brethren. Also, this previously mentioned mogwai is effectively immortal. As Gizmo is gentle and has a long list of historical figures that have owned him, it is clear that he was this mogwai type. If this mogwai eats after midnight though, he will lose his longevity, becoming a typical gremlin. However, as that was never mentioned in the movie, the credence to this nature of the mogwai/Gizmo is unknown. </p>
